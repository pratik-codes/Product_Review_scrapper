# Product_Review_scrapper
So I created and deployed an end-to-end web scrapper which scraps product reviews from a Flipkart.
I have reduced the amount of review and just included flipkart for the reviews so the i can reduced the time taken by the scrapper and
this will get you the idea of the project
